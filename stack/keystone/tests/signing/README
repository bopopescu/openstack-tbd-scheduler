The commands to create the various pem files for the signed tokens and
revocation list were generated by the associated make file.

The hashed value in the revocation list was generated using the revoked token using
the following python code

from keystone.common import cms,utils
f=open("tests/signing/auth_token_revoked.pem","r")
r=f.read()
utils.hash_signed_token(cms.cms_to_token(r))
f.close()
