OpenStack Client
================

python-openstackclient is a unified command-line client for the OpenStack APIs.  It is
a thin wrapper to the stock python-*client modules that implement the
actual REST API client actions.

This is an implementation of the design goals shown in 
http://wiki.openstack.org/UnifiedCLI.  The primary goal is to provide
a unified shell command structure and a common language to describe
operations in OpenStack.

python-openstackclient is designed to add support for API extensions via a
plugin mechanism

Getting Started
===============

We recommend using a virtualenv to install the client. This description
uses `virtualenvwrapper`_ to create the virtualenv. Install the prereqs,
then build the egg, and install the client into the virtualenv::

    mkvirtualenv openstackclient
    pip install -r tools/pip-requires
    python setup.py build
    easy_install dist/python_openstackclient-0.1-py2.7.egg

.. _virtualenvwrapper: http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper

If you want to work in development mode, do this instead::

    mkvirtualenv openstackclient
    pip install -r tools/pip-requires
    python setup.py develop

Toxicity tests can be ran simply by running ``run_tests.sh``

The client can be called interactively by simply typing::
   openstack

Alternatively command line parameters can be called non-interactively::
   openstack --help


Configuration
=============

The cli is configured via environment variables and command-line
options as listed in http://wiki.openstack.org/UnifiedCLI/Authentication.

The 'password flow' variation is most commonly used::

   export OS_AUTH_URL=<url-to-openstack-identity>
   export OS_TENANT_NAME=<tenant-name>
   export OS_USERNAME=<user-name>
   export OS_PASSWORD=<password> # (optional)
   export OS_USE_KEYRING=true # (optional)

The corresponding command-line options look very similar::

   --os-auth-url <url>
   --os-tenant-name <tenant-name>
   --os-username <user-name>
   [--os-password <password>]
   [--os-use-keyring]

If a password is not provided above (in plaintext), you will be interactively
prompted to provide one securely. If keyring is enabled, the password entered
in the prompt is stored in keyring. From next time, the password is read from
keyring, if it is not provided above (in plaintext).

The token flow variation for authentication uses an already-aquired token
and a URL pointing directly to the service API that presumably was acquired
from the Service Catalog::

    export OS_TOKEN=<token>
    export OS_URL=<url-to-openstack-service>

The corresponding command-line options look very similar::

    --os-token <token>
    --os-url <url-to-openstack-service>

Additional command-line options and their associated environment variables
are listed here::

   --debug             # turns on some debugging of the API conversation
                         (via httplib2)
   --verbose | -v      # Increase verbosity of output. Can be repeated.
   --quiet | -q        # suppress output except warnings and errors
   --help | -h         # show a help message and exit

Building Contributor Documentation
==================================

This documentation is written by contributors, for contributors.

The source is maintained in the ``doc/source`` folder using
`reStructuredText`_ and built by `Sphinx`_

.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

* Building Automatically::

    $ ./run_tests.sh --docs

* Building Manually::

    $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=local.local_settings
    $ python doc/generate_autodoc_index.py
    $ sphinx-build -b html doc/source build/sphinx/html

Results are in the `build/sphinx/html` directory
